# EdX's Undocumented Features

The [wiki](https://github.com/Colin-Fredericks/edx-undocumented/wiki) is where things are described and discussed. The files in this repo are for examples that take advantage of things described in the wiki.

This is NOT for documenting edX. EdX already has good documentation, and you should definitely check out the [official edX docs](http://docs.edx.org/) and the new [edX Developer Docs](https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OpenDev/Open+edX+Development).
